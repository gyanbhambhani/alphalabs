echo "Start the development server:"
echo "  cd frontend && npm run dev"
echo ""
echo "Then visit these pages to test the new components:"
echo ""
echo "1. Dashboard (http://localhost:3000)"
echo "   ✅ Decision Queue in sidebar"
echo "   ✅ Click decision → modal opens"
echo "   ✅ Loading states"
echo ""
echo "2. Time Machine (http://localhost:3000/backtest)"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced Decision Stream"
echo "   ✅ Streaming indicator when running"
echo "   ✅ Pipeline visualization"
echo "   ✅ Click decision → modal opens"
echo ""
echo "3. Fund Detail (http://localhost:3000/funds/[any-fund-id])"
echo "   ✅ Decision History tab uses DecisionQueue"
echo "   ✅ Filtering and search"
echo "   ✅ Enhanced decision viewer inline"
echo ""
echo "4. Test Decision Queue Features:"
echo "   ✅ Filter by type (All/Trades/No Trade)"
echo "   ✅ Search by fund or symbol"
echo "   ✅ Grouped by status (Active/Completed/Failed)"
echo "   ✅ Pipeline visualization shows progress"
echo "   ✅ Relative timestamps ('2m ago')"
